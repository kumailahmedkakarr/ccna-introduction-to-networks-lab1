# CCNA Network Fundamentals – Packet Tracer Lab 1

## Abstract
This project presents a foundational Cisco CCNA Packet Tracer laboratory exercise focused on identifying and understanding common network components. The lab explores physical and logical network representations, end devices, intermediary devices, and media types used in modern computer networks.

## Objectives
- Identify end devices, intermediary devices, and network media
- Explore physical and logical topology representations in Packet Tracer
- Understand the role of switches, routers, servers, and access points
- Compare and contrast LAN and WAN architectures
- Examine client-server network models

## Network Overview
The simulated network represents a small-to-medium enterprise environment consisting of branch offices, data centers, and internet connectivity. The topology includes wired and wireless connections, multiple LAN segments, and WAN links.

## Tools and Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco IOS (simulated)
- Ethernet, Fiber, Serial, and Wireless media

## Key Concepts Covered
- End devices vs intermediary devices
- Network media selection criteria
- Client-server architecture
- Local Area Networks (LAN)
- Wide Area Networks (WAN)
- Physical vs Logical network views

## Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this lab, the learner gains practical experience in:
- Navigating Packet Tracer environments
- Analyzing network topologies
- Identifying real-world network components
- Understanding foundational networking principles
